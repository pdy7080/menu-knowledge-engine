      "revised_prompt": "Create a professional food photograph of Gomtang, a traditional Korean beef bone soup. The dish is aesthetically presented in an authentic Korean ceramic bowl or plate. The lighting is studio-grade, creating soft shadows and contrast. The background is a sterile white or a rustic wooden table to provide a contrast to the fare. The dish should be viewed from a bird's eye perspective or a 45-degree angle, emphasizing the depth and texture of the soup. The Gomtang is garnished with sesame seeds, chopped green onions, or other traditional Korean garnishes. The overall visual representation should be photorealistic, mouth-watering, and worthy of a high-end restaurant. The image should be of high resolution, with sharp focus on the dish, and the colors vibrant and inviting.",
